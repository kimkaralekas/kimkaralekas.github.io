I’ve done a ton of reading, but as I’m a hands on learner, I know that I just need to keep trying to make stuff and see what happens. Praise the lord for Google as that’s been a lifesaver for when I need to figure something (everything) out every other second. (:

print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
